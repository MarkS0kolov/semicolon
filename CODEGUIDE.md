Hey there! This is SemiColon's code! It can be a bit messy (like the language itself), but I will try to
explain you it that you can understand and modify it.

A bit of information about the creators:
    MarkS0kolov - idea creator
    Dava (or Isk_D) - his friend, programer and person, who is writing this text)

Well, well, well... I think you are new to SemiColon's code, so I would suggest you to start from lexer, if 
you want to understand this code. And, of course, you have to read README.md or any other source, where you can
learn how to code (or suffer) in SemiColon.
